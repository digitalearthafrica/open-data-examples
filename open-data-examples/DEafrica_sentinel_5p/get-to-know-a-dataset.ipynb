    "### Dataset Organization & S3 Prefix Structure Overview\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top level of our S3 buckets, we follow a **consistent, product-centric prefix structure** that supports scalable, cloud-native access to **Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Level-2 products stored as Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dataset organisation and key S3 prefix structure\n",
    "1. **Top-level S3 bucket (per product)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Each atmospheric variable is stored in its own dedicated S3 bucket, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `deafrica-sentinel-5p-aer-ai`\n",
    "   * `deafrica-sentinel-5p-no2`\n",
    "   * `deafrica-sentinel-5p-ch4`\n",
    "   * `deafrica-sentinel-5p-so2`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This separation simplifies data discovery, access management, and scaling as data volumes grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mission prefix**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Sentinel-5p/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Identifies the satellite mission and allows future missions to be added without restructuring existing paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Instrument prefix**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   TROPOMI/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Specifies the sensor producing the observations and keeps all Sentinel-5P products organised consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Processing level and product prefix**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Each Level-2 product is stored in a dedicated directory, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_AI` – Aerosol Index\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_NO2` – Nitrogen Dioxide\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_SO2` – Sulphur Dioxide\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_CO` – Carbon Monoxide\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_CH4` – Methane\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_O3` – Ozone\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_HCHO` – Formaldehyde\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_CLOUD` – Cloud properties\n",
    "\n",
    "   This ensures a clear one-to-one mapping between scientific products and directory paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temporal partitioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Products are partitioned by time using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   YYYY/MM/DD/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   or, where appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   YYYY/MM/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   s3://deafrica-sentinel-5p-no2/Sentinel-5p/TROPOMI/TROPO_L2_NO2/2025/11/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Temporal partitioning enables efficient S3 prefix filtering and time-based subsetting in cloud workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Within each temporal directory are individual **Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF (`.tif`) files**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * each file represents a single Sentinel-5P overpass or daily mosaic\n",
    "   * internal tiling and overviews enable HTTP range requests\n",
    "   * files can be streamed directly into GIS tools, xarray/rioxarray, and Dask without full downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Full documentation for this dataset can be found at: [https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Sentinel-5P_specs.html](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Sentinel-5P_specs.html)\n",

    "***\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Data formats present in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF (COG) — `.tif`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is stored**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sentinel-5P TROPOMI **Level-2 atmospheric products** (e.g. CH₄, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, Aerosol Index, Clouds)\n",
    "* Each file represents a **single overpass or temporally aggregated product**\n",
    "* Raster grids with georeferencing, metadata, and quality information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this format is used**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Internally tiled with overviews\n",
    "* Supports HTTP range requests\n",
    "* Optimised for direct cloud access from S3\n",
    "\n",
    "**How we work with it**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stream directly from S3 using `rasterio`, `rioxarray`, or `xarray`\n",
    "* Subset spatially and temporally without downloading full files\n",
    "* Visualise instantly in GIS tools (QGIS, ArcGIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always treat these as *remote datasets*—avoid downloading unless necessary\n",
    "* Use windowed reads and bounding boxes for performance\n",
    "* Prefer `rioxarray.open_rasterio()` or STAC-based loading for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. STAC metadata (JSON)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is stored**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collection-level and item-level metadata exposed via the **Digital Earth Africa STAC catalogue**\n",
    "* Spatial extent, temporal coverage, projection, and asset links pointing to the COGs in S3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this format is used**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enables structured discovery and filtering of large datasets\n",
    "* Decouples metadata from physical storage layout\n",
    "\n",
    "**How we work with it**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Query using `pystac_client`\n",
    "* Filter by bounding box, time range, and product type\n",
    "* Use STAC assets to access COGs programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use STAC as the *entry point* rather than hard-coding S3 paths\n",
    "* Let STAC handle discovery; let raster tools handle reading\n",
    "\n",

    "#### What this visual shows\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each panel represents **Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentrations for a single solar day**, gridded over the area of interest.\n",
    "* The use of `col=\"time\"` creates a **small-multiples view**, making it easy to compare spatial patterns from day to day.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this is informative\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can immediately see **hotspots and gradients** in methane concentrations across space.\n",
    "* Day-to-day differences highlight **temporal variability**, which may be linked to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * emissions from agriculture, wetlands, or urban areas\n",
    "  * atmospheric transport\n",
    "  * changing observation conditions\n",
    "* Masked (blank) areas clearly show where **quality filtering** has removed invalid pixels, reinforcing confidence in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this should excite users\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is **satellite methane data streamed directly from the cloud**, not pre-downloaded files.\n",
    "* With just a few lines of code, users can:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * visualise atmospheric composition over any region\n",
    "  * build time series\n",
    "  * compare multiple Sentinel-5P products (e.g. CH₄ vs NO₂ or CO)\n",
    "* The same workflow scales seamlessly from **two days** to **multiple years** of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "This visual demonstrates that the dataset is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **analysis-ready**\n",
    "* **spatially rich**\n",
    "* **temporally dense**\n",
    "* and perfectly suited for **exploratory science, policy analysis, and storytelling**\n",
    "\n",
    "It invites users to dig deeper—whether to investigate emission sources, track changes over time, or combine methane with other atmospheric variables for a more complete picture of air quality and climate drivers."

    "\n",
    "To run the calculation, you only need to supply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The gas column variable** from your dataset  \n",

    "   - `ch4_column` is in ppb, it must be converted to an appropriate column amount (e.g., mol/m²) before converting it to tonnes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The molecular weight of the gas** (in g/mol)  \n",

    "In the cell below, we demonstrate how to compute the total atmospheric mass of Carbon Monoxide (CO) total column over the selected Area of Interest (AOI) using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Level-2 data from the CO dataset already loaded above. The calculation applies the previously defined conversion function, which transforms to total mass (tonnes) by combining pixel area and molecular weight, with optional cloud masking. This workflow quantifies the total Carbon Monoxide present within the AOI, and the same approach can be applied to other Sentinel-5P trace-gas products by supplying the relevant gas variable and molecular weight. Note: Methane(CH4) is reported in ppb, an additional conversion step will be included to convert it to mol/m² before computing tonnes. The dataMask flags whether a pixel contains a valid gas retrieval, while the s5p_tropomi_l2_cloud product provides cloud information—specifically the cloud_fraction—which we use to exclude pixels where cloud contamination would reduce the accuracy of atmospheric gas measurements. A cloud threshold of 0.3 is recommended because it effectively removes pixels where cloud contamination begins to significantly degrade gas retrieval accuracy while still preserving enough clear-sky observations for reliable analysis."

    "The plot below shows the CH₄ column values over the Area of Interest (AOI) after applying a cloud-fraction filter to remove pixels with excessive cloud contamination. Sentinel-5P methane retrievals can be strongly affected by cloud cover, so we retain only pixels where `cloud_fraction < 0.3`. This ensures that the visualisation reflects clearer and more reliable methane observations for the selected 2-day time period."

    "We queried Sentinel-5P TROPOMI CH₄ observations for a small area and short time window using the DE Africa STAC catalogue. The data were streamed as cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs into an Xarray Dataset, then filtered using the retrieval quality mask (`dataMask == 1`). To ensure physically meaningful mass estimates, we also loaded the Sentinel-5P cloud product and applied a cloud mask, retaining only pixels with low cloud cover. Finally, we converted the cloud-screened methane columns to total atmospheric mass (tonnes) and summarised the results as a time series.\n",
