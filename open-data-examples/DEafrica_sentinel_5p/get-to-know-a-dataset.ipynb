    "### Dataset Organization & S3 Prefix Structure Overview\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top level of our S3 buckets, we follow a **consistent, product-centric prefix structure** that supports scalable, cloud-native access to **Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Level-2 products stored as Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dataset organisation and key S3 prefix structure\n",
    "1. **Top-level S3 bucket (per product)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Each atmospheric variable is stored in its own dedicated S3 bucket, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `deafrica-sentinel-5p-aer-ai`\n",
    "   * `deafrica-sentinel-5p-no2`\n",
    "   * `deafrica-sentinel-5p-ch4`\n",
    "   * `deafrica-sentinel-5p-so2`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This separation simplifies data discovery, access management, and scaling as data volumes grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mission prefix**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Sentinel-5p/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Identifies the satellite mission and allows future missions to be added without restructuring existing paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Instrument prefix**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   TROPOMI/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Specifies the sensor producing the observations and keeps all Sentinel-5P products organised consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Processing level and product prefix**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Each Level-2 product is stored in a dedicated directory, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_AI` – Aerosol Index\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_NO2` – Nitrogen Dioxide\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_SO2` – Sulphur Dioxide\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_CO` – Carbon Monoxide\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_CH4` – Methane\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_O3` – Ozone\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_HCHO` – Formaldehyde\n",
    "   * `TROPO_L2_CLOUD` – Cloud properties\n",
    "\n",
    "   This ensures a clear one-to-one mapping between scientific products and directory paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temporal partitioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Products are partitioned by time using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   YYYY/MM/DD/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   or, where appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   YYYY/MM/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   s3://deafrica-sentinel-5p-no2/Sentinel-5p/TROPOMI/TROPO_L2_NO2/2025/11/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Temporal partitioning enables efficient S3 prefix filtering and time-based subsetting in cloud workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Within each temporal directory are individual **Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF (`.tif`) files**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * each file represents a single Sentinel-5P overpass or daily mosaic\n",
    "   * internal tiling and overviews enable HTTP range requests\n",
    "   * files can be streamed directly into GIS tools, xarray/rioxarray, and Dask without full downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Full documentation for this dataset can be found at: [https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Sentinel-5P_specs.html](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Sentinel-5P_specs.html)\n",

    "#### Data formats present in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFF (COG) — `.tif`\n",

    "**What is stored**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sentinel-5P TROPOMI **Level-2 atmospheric products** (e.g. CH₄, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, Aerosol Index, Clouds)\n",
    "* Each file represents a **single overpass or temporally aggregated product**\n",
    "* Raster grids with georeferencing, metadata, and quality information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this format is used**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Internally tiled with overviews\n",
    "* Supports HTTP range requests\n",
    "* Optimised for direct cloud access from S3\n",
    "\n",
    "**How we work with it**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stream directly from S3 using `rasterio`, `rioxarray`, or `xarray`\n",
    "* Subset spatially and temporally without downloading full files\n",
    "* Visualise instantly in GIS tools (QGIS, ArcGIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always treat these as *remote datasets*—avoid downloading unless necessary\n",
    "* Use windowed reads and bounding boxes for performance\n",
    "* Prefer `rioxarray.open_rasterio()` or STAC-based loading for analysis\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is stored**\n",

    "* Collection-level and item-level metadata exposed via the **Digital Earth Africa STAC catalogue**\n",
    "* Spatial extent, temporal coverage, projection, and asset links pointing to the COGs in S3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this format is used**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enables structured discovery and filtering of large datasets\n",
    "* Decouples metadata from physical storage layout\n",
    "\n",
    "**How we work with it**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Query using `pystac_client`\n",
    "* Filter by bounding box, time range, and product type\n",
    "* Use STAC assets to access COGs programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use STAC as the *entry point* rather than hard-coding S3 paths\n",
    "* Let STAC handle discovery; let raster tools handle reading\n",

    "In the cell below, we demonstrate how to compute the total atmospheric mass of Carbon Monoxide (CO) total column over the selected Area of Interest (AOI) using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Level-2 data from the CO dataset already loaded above. The calculation applies the previously defined conversion function, which transforms to total mass (tonnes) by combining pixel area and molecular weight, with optional cloud masking. This workflow quantifies the total Carbon Monoxide present within the AOI, and the same approach can be applied to other Sentinel-5P trace-gas products by supplying the relevant gas variable and molecular weight. Note: Methane(CH4) is reported in ppb, an additional conversion step will be included to convert it to mol/m² before computing tonnes. The dataMask flags whether a pixel contains a valid gas retrieval, while the s5p_tropomi_l2_cloud product provides cloud information—specifically the cloud_fraction—which we use to exclude pixels where cloud contamination would reduce the accuracy of atmospheric gas measurements. A cloud threshold of 0.3 is recommended because it effectively removes pixels where cloud contamination begins to significantly degrade gas retrieval accuracy while still preserving enough clear-sky observations for reliable analysis."
